It has passed all safety tests related to these certifications for household appliances, emission, disturbances, laboratory use, Ozone production amongst others. Shycocan attenuates 99.9% of the CORONAVIRUS virus from transmission in closed spaces as per tests conducted by a leading virology lab in the world."},{id:4,title:"How does Shycocan work?",data:"The Coronavirus is a Positive-Sense virus, whose S-Protein attaches to the human cell through the ACE2 receptors due to the opposite charge. All human cells have a negative potential (about -40mV to -70mV). The virus infuses its RNA into the cells and starts to multiply, infecting the body. Shycocan continuously emits photons that form an electron cloud in an indoor space. The negative charged electrons neutralize the positive charge of the S-Protein of Coronavirus, thereby disabling it from infecting a person."},{id:5,title:"Does Shycocan kill the Corona Virus?",data:"Shycocan does not kill the Corona virus. The device attenuates the virus due to the unique action of neutralizing its charge on the Spike Protein (S-Protein) of the virus."},{id:6,title:"What are the viruses or diseases against which Shycocan is effective?",data:"Apart from the CORONAVIRUS virus, Shycocan attenuates the full spectrum of viruses belonging to Corona and Influenza family. These Positive-Sense viruses are enveloped with S-Protein which gets disabled by electrons. The Coronavirus family of viruses cause Pneumonia, Bronchiolitis, ARDS, MERS, SARS & COVID- 19; and the Influenza family of viruses cause annual seasonal cases of flu, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, and many other varieties of viral flu. It can also protect from future pandemics caused by variants or mutants of these viruses of Corona and Influenza family."},{id:7,title:"Does Shycocan affect bacteria, fungi, and other microbes?",data:"Shycocan does not affect any bacteria, fungi or other microbes; other than the Corona and Influenza family of viruses. It is very critical to maintain a balance of microbes in the environment, as a very sanitized environment can increase toxicity and compromise the immune system of humans."},{id:8,title:"Does Shycocan emit Photons or Electrons?",data:"Shycocan emits Photons through a specialized alloy. The photons emit electrons on coming in contact with a solid surface. Hence, the whole action is termed as Photon-Mediated-Electron-Emission (PMEE)."},{id:9,title:"Does the Shycocan work indoor and/or outdoor?",data:"Shycocan is designed to work effectively in an indoor space. It may be partially effective in the outdoor space in areas where the photon rays strike directly."},{id:10,title:"How to setup Shycocan? Where shall I install Shycocan (s)?",data:"Shycocan is a plug and play device that just needs to be switched ON. It is plugged into a standard A/C outlet. The installation is recommended using the wall stand provided with the device. The placement of the device is at a height of 7 feet or above on the wall that is close to one of the corners of the room pointing diagonally towards the opposite diagonal corner. This allows the maximum coverage of the room for protection."},{id:11,title:"What is the coverage area of Shycocan?",data:"Shycocan covers an area of 10,000 cubic feet or 1,000 sq feet for space with a roof of 10 feet height. Multiple devices may be installed for larger spaces and placed as per the recommendation of our trained service professionals."},{id:12,title:"How to setup Shycocan devices in larger spaces?",data:"Shycocan devices are currently designed for a single non-partitioned enclosed space of upto 1000 square feet. You can install multiple Shycocan devices for a larger area e.g. an office space with 2500 square feet would need 3 devices. It is recommended that they be placed at an equal distance or in the opposite corners of the room or alternatively on opposite walls for optimal coverage. Please use our trained service professionals for design optimization on request."},{id:13,title:"Will a single Shycocan cover my entire house?",data:"One device covers one room up to 1000 square feet of uninterrupted space. It does not cover any area outside of the indoor space where it is installed, even if the room size is much smaller or with any partitions. Under these conditions, every room in the house that needs to be under protection requires one device each."},{id:14,title:"Where should Shycocan be installed?",data:"Shycocan may be deployed safely in all environments both large and small enclosed spaces. Shycocan builds a safer environment in hospitals, clinics, homes, retail stores, restaurants & hotels, schools & colleges, places of worship, residential, commercial buildings, industrial and sporting environments etc."},{id:15,title:"Does the effectiveness of Shycocan reduce if the number of people in the given area increases?",data:"It is recommended that people maintain reasonable distance, avoid body contact and not overcrowd the indoor space. There is a need to allow the Photons to cover the whole room and provide protection by releasing electrons that neutralize the virus. e.g. a conference room with normal seating would be safe to operate. However, very close proximity of people in a room or a space may reduce its effectiveness."},{id:17,title:"Does Shycocan cure a CORONAVIRUS affected patient?",data:"Shycocan stops the transmission of the virus from the patient to other people who are not infected by the virus in the closed space where the device is installed. But, it does not help to cure patients that have already tested positive for CORONAVIRUS."},{id:18,title:"How long does the effect of Shycocan last?",data:"Shycocan needs to be kept operational continuously to protect the transmission of the CORONAVIRUS virus in the closed space. It is recommended that power back-up be installed to ensure that it does not stop working during any power failure."},{id:20,title:"Should people having any medical ailments avoid using the Shycocan?",data:"There are no known side-effects of Shycocan on people facing any medical condition. It is considered safe and highly recommended to be used to protect patients of any other medical ailments from contracting CORONAVIRUS as they may already have a depressed immune system due to other ailments."},{id:21,title:"What is the possibility of a person exposed to Shycocan contracting Coronavirus once he/she moves beyond the device reach?",data:"Shycocan protects the indoor space where it is installed. Once the person leaves that indoor space where the device is installed, they need to take precautions as advised by WHO guidelines."},{id:22,title:"Can the photon rays emitted from Shycocan ",data:"contaminate food or water? Shycocan does not harm food, water, and the environment."},{id:23,title:"May I keep my windows and doors open in a room where a Shycocan is running?",data:"It is advisable to keep the doors and windows closed wherever possible. In case, they need to be kept open, Shycocan should be installed pointing away from the open windows or doors towards a wall or the closed area to maximise the emission of electrons."},{id:24,title:"What maintenance is required for a Shycocan devices?",data:"Shycocan needs cleaning in the front plate to maintain the air circulation. This can be done by the customer. It does not require a periodic change of consumables or any other component."},{id:25,title:"How many hours should I keep it on? What is the electricity consumption?",data:"Shycocan is designed for continuous use. It is recommended to be kept ON 24/7 or start thirty minutes before the closed space is used.

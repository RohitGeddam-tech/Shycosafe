All human cells have a negative potential (about -40mV to -70mV). The virus infuses its RNA into the cells and starts to multiply, infecting the body. Shycocan continuously emits photons that form an electron cloud in an indoor space. The negative charged electrons neutralize the positive charge of the S-Protein of Coronavirus, thereby disabling it from infecting a person.\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    title: \"Does Shycocan kill the Corona Virus?\",\n    data: \"Shycocan does not kill the Corona virus.

These Positive-Sense viruses are enveloped with S-Protein which gets disabled by electrons. The Coronavirus family of viruses cause Pneumonia, Bronchiolitis, ARDS, MERS, SARS & COVID- 19; and the Influenza family of viruses cause annual seasonal cases of flu, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, and many other varieties of viral flu. It can also protect from future pandemics caused by variants or mutants of these viruses of Corona and Influenza family.\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 7,\n    title: \"Does Shycocan affect bacteria, fungi, and other microbes?\",\n    data: \"Shycocan does not affect any bacteria, fungi or other microbes; other than the Corona and Influenza family of viruses.

While working for over five\n              years on another patent, Dr. Kumar developed a highly specialized\n              alloy that produced Photons in 2016. The trigger of building the\n              device was a Bird Flu pandemic that resulted in many poultry\n              farmers going bankrupt at the end of 2017. The Bird Flu virus\n              belongs to the Influenza family; hence these devices were\n              installed at Dr. Kumar’s campus to test their efficacy on stopping\n              the transmission of the virus. It was observed at the end of 2018\n              that there was a reduction of ninety percent in the incidence of\n              seasonal flu’s amongst employees over the previous two years. This\n              device was then tested post the CORONAVIRUS pandemic in accredited\n              laboratories for safety and efficacy. It was seen that it disabled\n              the CORONAVIRUS and Influenza viruses by 99.9% in closed spaces as\n              per the result.\n              <br />\n              CORONAVIRUS has a similar Positive-Sense S-protein structure to\n              the Bird Flu and Seasonal Flu virus.
